#Starfield!

Decided to try my hand in 2D JS animations.

##To do
This project is far from over. There are a couple more ideas I could implement. In the future perhaps:
- Implement scrolling in alignment with the stars. (I feel like the "camera" pans faster than the stars)
- Depth perception
- Lightspeed simulation (à la classic science-fiction line strokes)
- Space dust...?
